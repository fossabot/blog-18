{% blockquote Seth Godin http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/07/welcome-to-island-marketing.html Welcome to Island Marketing %}
Every interaction is both precious and an opportunity to delight.

{% blockquote Douglas Adams, The Hichhikers Guide to the Galaxy %}
Flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
{% endblockquote %}

{% pullquote %}
Surround your paragraph with the pull quote tags. Then when you come to
the text you want to pull, {" surround it like this "} and that's all there is to it.
{% endpullquote %}

{% codeblock [title] [lang:language] [url] [link text] %}
code snippet
{% endcodeblock %}

``` [language] [title] [url] [link text]
code snippet
```

{% include_code [title] [lang:language] path/to/file %}

{% include_code Add to_fraction for floats ruby/test.rb %}
This includes a file from source/downloads/code/ruby/test.rb.

{% render_partial path/to/file %}
The render_partial tag resolves paths to the source directory, so write your paths accordingly.

You may have two pages which need to share some of the same content. To prevent your partial from being rendered by Jekyll as a page, add an underscore to the beginning of the file name, or put it in a directory that begins with an underscore. For example, if you wanted multiple pages to share a table of contents, you might create source/documentation/_partials/TOC.markdown. Any post or page could import this file like this:

{% render_partial documentation/TOC.markdown %}
